          <h2>Organic Backyard Farming for Everyone: The Future of Food</h2>
          <p>
          Backyard farming is a movement in which everyday spaces are turned
          into mini or micro-farms. It's a deliberate approach to growing and
          harvesting your own fruits and vegetables in a sustainable way without
          worrying about needing a large area and do it in an organic way. You donâ€™t need a big chunk of
          land to make it happen. So, where does it begin? What makes this
          possible?

          The Philippines started to recognize the importance of this farming practice in 2005 as seen in the passage of the Republic Act. 10068 or The Promotion and Development of Organic Agriculture in the Philippines, which provided goverment support to this sector.

      <h2>Tips And Ideas For Sustainable Backyard Gardening</h2>
      <div class="row"></div>
      <div class="col">
        <h5>Pick your plant correctly</h5>
        <img src="image/4.jfif" alt="garden" width="250px", height=200px>
        <p>Backyard gardening can incorporate tens of plants. However, based on your setting, you have to choose the crop to palnet correctly. Herbs and leafy greens are ideal as they are less complex as compared to fruits, peppers, and tomatoes.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col">
        <h5>You have to consider the sun</h5>
        <img src="image/4.jfif" alt="garden" width="250px", height=200px>
        <p>If your garden is in a bit of a dark place, most crops will not do well. Exposure to sunlight is vital for the survival of a plant and waithout such light, most crops won't do well.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col">
        <h5>Consider your space</h5>
        <img src="image/4.jfif" alt="garden" width="250px", height=200px>
        <p>Backyard gardening can incorporate the growth of trees. However, if your space is limited, you, therefore, should not plant trees. Limited space waill not only squeeze the crop but also yourself and your access to space</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col">
        <h5>Over watering kills</h5>
        <img src="image/4.jfif" alt="garden" width="250px", height=200px>
        <p>Most backyard gardening use containers and have limited space for draining excess water. Over watering the crops  will, therefore, kill them as there will not be enough space to take the excess water. To fix this, consider adding drainage holes to your container so that the soil does not become waterlogged and kills the plants.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col">
        <h5>Consider vertical gardening</h5>
        <img src="image/4.jfif" alt="garden" width="250px", height=200px>
        <p>Instead of filling the limited space with crops and lacking a spot to walk on, it is advisable to use the space upwards. As such, you can plant them in pots that can be hung, utilizing all the space going upwards.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col">
        <h5>Planning right</h5>
        <img src="image/4.jfif" alt="garden" width="250px", height=200px>
        <p>When planting, you have to put gravel at the bottom of the container, before adding some soil. You should also leave about an inch at the top of the container, for watering.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col">
        <h5>Choosing your soil</h5>
        <img src="image/4.jfif" alt="garden" width="250px", height=200px>
        <p>The soil you use is vital to the quality of the crop harvested. Some go for soil sprayed with pesticides, but forget that it is loaded with chemicals. As such, the end result will not be purely organic.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col">
        <h5>Watering hours</h5>
        <img src="image/4.jfif" alt="garden" width="250px", height=200px>
        <p>It is not possible to pinpoint the time it is best for watering the plants as this may vary due to rainfall patterns and soil water retention capacity. However, it is ideal to water your garden in the evening and early mornings, so that the crops use up the water for a longer period before the afternoon heat.</p>

      <h2>Challenges And Implementations</h2>
      <p><strong><em>"With wrong farming methods, we turn fertile land into desert. Unless we go back to organic farming and save the soil there is no FUTURE!" Unknown</em></strong></p>
      <p>Food production has now been threatened by various factors such as climate change, war and conversion, to name a few. In the Philippines, although the impact is imminent, organic farming has a slim chance to become a national practice, making the farming method unknown to most to most Filipinos. The dissemination of information about organic farming is too bland and not too many.
        If fully implemented, this could address the following socio-economic issues such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Food shortage, dependence on importation and malnutrition</li>
        <li>Carbon emission due to food waste</li>
        <li>Creating more jobs in Agricultural sector</li>

        <p><strong><em>Nicole Obligacion</em></strong> is pursuing a career in gardening as an Urban Gardener Mentor. In the middle of the pandemic, she started an online page called Anyone Can Garden, where she gives out tips on how to grow and take care of plants. Nicole began gardening in 2013 as a concrete reminder to keep herself evolving. Her first batch of plants, cherry tomatoes and broccoli, were grown on their balcony. The convenience motivated her to continue growing her own food at home, including sweet corn, okra, melon, green peas, pechay, lettuce, carrots, eggplants, chilies, basil, ginger, upland kangkong, oregano, calamansi, peanuts, french marigolds, and onion chives.</p>
